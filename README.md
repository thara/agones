Agones is a library for hosting, running and scaling [dedicated game servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server#Dedicated_server) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

_Agones, is derived from the Greek word agōn which roughly translates to “contest”, “competition at games” and “gathering”.

## Disclaimer
This software is currently alpha, and subject to change. Not to be used in production systems.

## Major Features
- Be able to define a `GameServer` within Kubernetes - either through yaml or via the API
- Manage GameServer lifecycles - including health checking and connection information.
- Client SDKs for integration with dedicated game servers to work with Agones.

## Why does this project exist?
For more details on why this project was written, read the 
[announcement blog post](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/03/introducing-Agones-open-source-multiplayer-dedicated-game-server-hosting-built-on-Kubernetes.html).

## Requirements
- Kubernetes cluster version 1.9+
    - [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) and [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) have been tested
    - If you are creating and managing your own Kubernetes cluster, the
    [MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook-beta-in-19), and 
    [ValidatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#validatingadmissionwebhook-alpha-in-18-beta-in-19)
    admission controllers are required.
    We also recommend following the
    [recommended set of admission controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#is-there-a-recommended-set-of-admission-controllers-to-use).
- Firewall access for the range of ports that Game Servers can be connected to in the cluster.
- Game Servers must have the [project SDK](sdks) integrated, to manage Game Server state, health checking, etc.

## Installation

Follow [these instructions](install/README.md) to create a cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Minikube, and install Agones.

## Usage

Documentation and usage guides on how to develop and host dedicated game servers on top of Agones.

### Quickstarts:
 - [Create a Game Server](./docs/create_gameserver.md)
 - [Create a Game Server Fleet](./docs/create_fleet.md)
 - [Edit Your First Game Server (Go)](./docs/edit_first_game_server.md)

### Guides
 - [Integrating the Game Server SDK](sdks)
 - [GameServer Health Checking](./docs/health_checking.md)
 - [Accessing Agones via the Kubernetes API](./docs/access_api.md)

### Reference
- [Game Server Specification](./docs/gameserver_spec.md)
- [Fleet Specification](./docs/fleet_spec.md)

### Examples
- [Full GameServer Configuration](./examples/gameserver.yaml)
- [Full Fleet Configuration](./examples/fleet.yaml)
- [Full Fleet Allocation Configuration](./examples/fleetallocation.yaml)
- [Simple UDP](./examples/simple-udp) (Go) - simple server and client that send UDP packets back and forth.
- [CPP Simple](./examples/cpp-simple) (C++) - C++ example that starts up, stays healthy and then shuts down after 60 seconds.
- [Xonotic](./examples/xonotic) - Wraps the SDK around the open source FPS game [Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org) and hosts it on Agones.
